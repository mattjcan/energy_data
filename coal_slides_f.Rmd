# US coal exports could increase 

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[
- US coal exports to Asia more than doubled in 2017, although from a low base. 

- Additional US coal exports to Asia are limited by the lack of bulk coal export facilities on the US west coast. However, there are 7 proposed coal terminals and combined they could handle over 125 million tonnes per year. 

- Earlier this year, Wyoming, Montana, Kansas, Utah, South Dakota, and Nebraska took Washington state to the federal court, arguing that the stateâ€™s rejection of coal export terminals was a restraint on their trade.
